NAME
     getaddrinfo, freeaddrinfo – socket address structure to host and service
     name

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netdb.h>

     int
     getaddrinfo(const char *hostname, const char *servname,
	 const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);

     void
     freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *ai);

DESCRIPTION
     The getaddrinfo() function is used to get a list of IP addresses and port
     numbers for host hostname and service servname.  It is a replacement for
     and provides more flexibility than the gethostbyname(3) and
     getservbyname(3) functions.

     The hostname and servname arguments are either pointers to NUL-terminated
     strings or the null pointer.  An acceptable value for hostname is either
     a valid host name or a numeric host address string consisting of a dotted
     decimal IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  The servname is either a
     decimal port number or a service name listed in services(5).  At least
     one of hostname and servname must be non-null.

     hints is an optional pointer to a struct addrinfo, as defined by
     ⟨netdb.h⟩:

     struct addrinfo {
	     int ai_flags;	     /* input flags */
	     int ai_family;	     /* protocol family for socket */
	     int ai_socktype;	     /* socket type */
	     int ai_protocol;	     /* protocol for socket */
	     socklen_t ai_addrlen;   /* length of socket-address */
	     struct sockaddr *ai_addr; /* socket-address for socket */
	     char *ai_canonname;     /* canonical name for service location */
	     struct addrinfo *ai_next; /* pointer to next in list */
     };

     This structure can be used to provide hints concerning the type of socket
     that the caller supports or wishes to use.  The caller can supply the
     following structure elements in hints:

     ai_family	    The protocol family that should be used.  When ai_family
		    is set to PF_UNSPEC, it means the caller will accept any
		    protocol family supported by the operating system.

     ai_socktype    Denotes the type of socket that is wanted: SOCK_STREAM,
		    SOCK_DGRAM, or SOCK_RAW.  When ai_socktype is zero the
		    caller will accept any socket type.

     ai_protocol    Indicates which transport protocol is desired, IPPROTO_UDP
		    or IPPROTO_TCP.  If ai_protocol is zero the caller will
		    accept any protocol.

     ai_flags	    The ai_flags field to which the hints parameter points
		    shall be set to zero or be the bitwise-inclusive OR of one
		    or more of the values AI_ADDRCONFIG, AI_ALL, AI_CANONNAME,
		    AI_NUMERICHOST, AI_NUMERICSERV, AI_PASSIVE, AI_V4MAPPED,
		    AI_V4MAPPED_CFG, and AI_DEFAULT.

		    AI_ADDRCONFIG   If the AI_ADDRCONFIG bit is set, IPv4
				    addresses shall be returned only if an
				    IPv4 address is configured on the local
				    system, and IPv6 addresses shall be
				    returned only if an IPv6 address is
				    configured on the local system.

		    AI_ALL	    If the AI_ALL bit is set with the
				    AI_V4MAPPED bit, then getaddrinfo() shall
				    return all matching IPv6 and IPv4
				    addresses.	The AI_ALL bit without the
				    AI_V4MAPPED bit is ignored.

		    AI_CANONNAME    If the AI_CANONNAME bit is set, a
				    successful call to getaddrinfo() will
				    return a NUL-terminated string containing
				    the canonical name of the specified
				    hostname in the ai_canonname element of
				    the first addrinfo structure returned.

		    AI_NUMERICHOST  If the AI_NUMERICHOST bit is set, it
				    indicates that hostname should be treated
				    as a numeric string defining an IPv4 or
				    IPv6 address and no name resolution should
				    be attempted.

		    AI_NUMERICSERV  If the AI_NUMERICSERV bit is set, then a
				    non-null servname string supplied shall be
				    a numeric port string.  Otherwise, an
				    EAI_NONAME error shall be returned.  This
				    bit shall prevent any type of name
				    resolution service (for example, NIS+)
				    from being invoked.

		    AI_PASSIVE	    If the AI_PASSIVE bit is set it indicates
				    that the returned socket address structure
				    is intended for use in a call to bind(2).
				    In this case, if the hostname argument is
				    the null pointer, then the IP address
				    portion of the socket address structure
				    will be set to INADDR_ANY for an IPv4
				    address or IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for an IPv6
				    address.

				    If the AI_PASSIVE bit is not set, the
				    returned socket address structure will be
				    ready for use in a call to connect(2) for
				    a connection-oriented protocol or
				    connect(2), sendto(2), or sendmsg(2) if a
				    connectionless protocol was chosen.  The
				    IP address portion of the socket address
				    structure will be set to the loopback
				    address if hostname is the null pointer
				    and AI_PASSIVE is not set.

		    AI_V4MAPPED     If the AI_V4MAPPED flag is specified along
				    with an ai_family of PF_INET6, then
				    getaddrinfo() shall return IPv4-mapped
				    IPv6 addresses on finding no matching IPv6
				    addresses ( ai_addrlen shall be 16).  The
				    AI_V4MAPPED flag shall be ignored unless
				    ai_family equals PF_INET6.

		    AI_V4MAPPED_CFG
				    The AI_V4MAPPED_CFG flag behaves exactly
				    like the AI_V4MAPPED flag if the kernel
				    supports IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
				    Otherwise it is ignored.

		    AI_DEFAULT	    AI_DEFAULT is defined as ( AI_V4MAPPED_CFG
				    | AI_ADDRCONFIG ).

		    AI_UNUSABLE     To override the automatic AI_DEFAULT
				    behavior that occurs when ai_flags is zero
				    pass AI_UNUSABLE instead of zero.  This
				    suppresses the implicit setting of
				    AI_V4MAPPED_CFG and AI_ADDRCONFIG, thereby
				    causing unusable addresses to be included
				    in the results.

     If ai_flags is zero, getaddrinfo() gives the AI_DEFAULT behavior (
     AI_V4MAPPED_CFG | AI_ADDRCONFIG ). To override this default behavior,
     pass any nonzero value for ai_flags, by setting any desired flag values,
     or setting AI_UNUSABLE if no other flags are desired.

     All other elements of the addrinfo structure passed via hints must be
     zero or the null pointer.

     If hints is the null pointer, getaddrinfo() behaves as if the caller
     provided a struct addrinfo with ai_family set to PF_UNSPEC and all other
     elements set to zero or NULL (which includes treating the ai_flags field
     as effectively zero, giving the automatic default AI_DEFAULT behavior).

     After a successful call to getaddrinfo(), *res is a pointer to a linked
     list of one or more addrinfo structures.  The list can be traversed by
     following the ai_next pointer in each addrinfo structure until a null
     pointer is encountered.  The three members ai_family, ai_socktype, and
     ai_protocol in each returned addrinfo structure are suitable for a call
     to socket(2).  For each addrinfo structure in the list, the ai_addr
     member points to a filled-in socket address structure of length
     ai_addrlen.

     This implementation of getaddrinfo() allows numeric IPv6 address notation
     with scope identifier, as documented in section 11 of RFC 4007.  By
     appending the percent character and scope identifier to addresses, one
     can fill the sin6_scope_id field for addresses.  This would make
     management of scoped addresses easier and allows cut-and-paste input of
     scoped addresses.

     At this moment the code supports only link-local addresses with the
     format.  The scope identifier is hardcoded to the name of the hardware
     interface associated with the link (such as ne0).	An example is
     “fe80::1%ne0”, which means “fe80::1 on the link associated with the ne0
     interface”.

     The current implementation assumes a one-to-one relationship between the
     interface and link, which is not necessarily true from the specification.

     All of the information returned by getaddrinfo() is dynamically
     allocated: the addrinfo structures themselves as well as the socket
     address structures and the canonical host name strings included in the
     addrinfo structures.

     Memory allocated for the dynamically allocated structures created by a
     successful call to getaddrinfo() is released by the freeaddrinfo()
     function.	The ai pointer should be an addrinfo structure created by a
     call to getaddrinfo().

     The current implementation supports synthesis of NAT64 mapped IPv6
     addresses.  If hostname is a numeric string defining an IPv4 address (for
     example, “192.0.2.1” ) and ai_family is set to PF_UNSPEC or PF_INET6,
     getaddrinfo() will synthesize the appropriate IPv6 address(es) (for
     example, “64:ff9b::192.0.2.1” ) if the current interface supports IPv6,
     NAT64 and DNS64 and does not support IPv4. If the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag is
     set, the IPv4 address will be suppressed on those interfaces.  On non-
     qualifying interfaces, getaddrinfo() is guaranteed to return immediately
     without attempting any resolution, and will return the IPv4 address if
     ai_family is PF_UNSPEC or PF_INET. NAT64 address synthesis can be
     disabled by setting the AI_NUMERICHOST flag. To best support NAT64
     networks, it is recommended to resolve all IP address literals with
     ai_family set to PF_UNSPEC and ai_flags set to AI_DEFAULT.

     Note that NAT64 address synthesis is always disabled for IPv4 addresses
     in the following ranges: 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16,
     192.0.0.0/29, 192.88.99.0/24, 224.0.0.0/4, and 255.255.255.255/32.
     Additionally, NAT64 address synthesis is disabled when the network uses
     the well-known prefix (64:ff9b::/96) for IPv4 addresses in the following
     ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 100.64.0.0/10, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.

     Historically, passing a host's own hostname to getaddrinfo() has been a
     popular technique for determining that host's IP address(es), but this is
     fragile, and doesn't work reliably in all cases. The appropriate way for
     software to discover the IP address(es) of the host it is running on is
     to use getifaddrs(3).

     The getaddrinfo() implementations on all versions of OS X and iOS are
     now, and always have been, thread-safe. Previous versions of this man
     page incorrectly reported that getaddrinfo() was not thread-safe.

RETURN VALUES
     getaddrinfo() returns zero on success or one of the error codes listed in
     gai_strerror(3) if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The following code tries to connect to “www.kame.net” service “http” via
     a stream socket.  It loops through all the addresses available,
     regardless of address family.  If the destination resolves to an IPv4
     address, it will use an PF_INET socket.  Similarly, if it resolves to
     IPv6, an PF_INET6 socket is used.	Observe that there is no hardcoded
     reference to a particular address family.	The code works even if
     getaddrinfo() returns addresses that are not IPv4/v6.

	   struct addrinfo hints, *res, *res0;
	   int error;
	   int s;
	   const char *cause = NULL;

	   memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
	   hints.ai_family = PF_UNSPEC;
	   hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	   error = getaddrinfo("www.kame.net", "http", &hints, &res0);
	   if (error) {
		   errx(1, "%s", gai_strerror(error));
		   /*NOTREACHED*/
	   }
	   s = -1;
	   for (res = res0; res; res = res->ai_next) {
		   s = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype,
		       res->ai_protocol);
		   if (s < 0) {
			   cause = "socket";
			   continue;
		   }

		   if (connect(s, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen) < 0) {
			   cause = "connect";
			   close(s);
			   s = -1;
			   continue;
		   }

		   break;  /* okay we got one */
	   }
	   if (s < 0) {
		   err(1, "%s", cause);
		   /*NOTREACHED*/
	   }
	   freeaddrinfo(res0);

     The following example tries to open a wildcard listening socket onto
     service “http”, for all the address families available.

	   struct addrinfo hints, *res, *res0;
	   int error;
	   int s[MAXSOCK];
	   int nsock;
	   const char *cause = NULL;

	   memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
	   hints.ai_family = PF_UNSPEC;
	   hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	   hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;
	   error = getaddrinfo(NULL, "http", &hints, &res0);
	   if (error) {
		   errx(1, "%s", gai_strerror(error));
		   /*NOTREACHED*/
	   }
	   nsock = 0;
	   for (res = res0; res && nsock < MAXSOCK; res = res->ai_next) {
		   s[nsock] = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype,
		       res->ai_protocol);
		   if (s[nsock] < 0) {
			   cause = "socket";
			   continue;
		   }

		   if (bind(s[nsock], res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen) < 0) {
			   cause = "bind";
			   close(s[nsock]);
			   continue;
		   }
		   (void) listen(s[nsock], 5);

		   nsock++;
	   }
	   if (nsock == 0) {
		   err(1, "%s", cause);
		   /*NOTREACHED*/
	   }
	   freeaddrinfo(res0);
