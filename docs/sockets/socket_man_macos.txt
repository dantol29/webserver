NAME
     socket – create an endpoint for communication

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>

     int
     socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
     socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor.

     The domain parameter specifies a communications domain within which
     communication will take place; this selects the protocol family which
     should be used.  These families are defined in the include file
     ⟨sys/socket.h⟩.  The currently understood formats are

	   PF_LOCAL	   Host-internal protocols, formerly called PF_UNIX,
	   PF_UNIX	   Host-internal protocols, deprecated, use PF_LOCAL,
	   PF_INET	   Internet version 4 protocols,
	   PF_ROUTE	   Internal Routing protocol,
	   PF_KEY	   Internal key-management function,
	   PF_INET6	   Internet version 6 protocols,
	   PF_SYSTEM	   System domain,
	   PF_NDRV	   Raw access to network device,
	   PF_VSOCK	   VM Sockets protocols

     The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the semantics of
     communication.  Currently defined types are:

	   SOCK_STREAM
	   SOCK_DGRAM
	   SOCK_RAW

     A SOCK_STREAM type provides sequenced, reliable, two-way connection based
     byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be
     supported.  A SOCK_DGRAM socket supports datagrams (connectionless,
     unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length).
     SOCK_RAW sockets provide access to internal network protocols and
     interfaces.  The type SOCK_RAW, which is available only to the super-
     user.

     The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
     Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular socket
     type within a given protocol family.  However, it is possible that many
     protocols may exist, in which case a particular protocol must be
     specified in this manner.	The protocol number to use is particular to
     the “communication domain” in which communication is to take place; see
     protocols(5).

     Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams, similar to
     pipes.  A stream socket must be in a connected state before any data may
     be sent or received on it.  A connection to another socket is created
     with a connect(2) or connectx(2) call.  Once connected, data may be
     transferred using read(2) and write(2) calls or some variant of the
     send(2) and recv(2) calls.  When a session has been completed a close(2)
     may be performed.	Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described
     in send(2) and received as described in recv(2).

     The communications protocols used to implement a SOCK_STREAM insure that
     data is not lost or duplicated.  If a piece of data for which the peer
     protocol has buffer space cannot be successfully transmitted within a
     reasonable length of time, then the connection is considered broken and
     calls will indicate an error with -1 returns and with ETIMEDOUT as the
     specific code in the global variable errno.  The protocols optionally
     keep sockets “warm” by forcing transmissions roughly every minute in the
     absence of other activity.  An error is then indicated if no response can
     be elicited on an otherwise idle connection for a extended period (e.g. 5
     minutes).	A SIGPIPE signal is raised if a process sends on a broken
     stream; this causes naive processes, which do not handle the signal, to
     exit.

     SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets allow sending of datagrams to
     correspondents named in send(2) calls.  Datagrams are generally received
     with recvfrom(2), which returns the next datagram with its return
     address.

     An fcntl(2) call can be used to specify a process group to receive a
     SIGURG signal when the out-of-band data arrives.  It may also enable non-
     blocking I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events via SIGIO.

     The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level options.  These
     options are defined in the file ⟨sys/socket.h⟩.  Setsockopt(2) and
     getsockopt(2) are used to set and get options, respectively.

RETURN VALUES
     A -1 is returned if an error occurs, otherwise the return value is a
     descriptor referencing the socket.

ERRORS
     The socket() system call fails if:

     [EACCES]		Permission to create a socket of the specified type
			and/or protocol is denied.

     [EAFNOSUPPORT]	The specified address family is not supported.

     [EMFILE]		The per-process descriptor table is full.

     [ENFILE]		The system file table is full.

     [ENOBUFS]		Insufficient buffer space is available.  The socket
			cannot be created until sufficient resources are
			freed.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
			request.

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]	The protocol type or the specified protocol is not
			supported within this domain.

     [EPROTOTYPE]	The socket type is not supported by the protocol.

     If a new protocol family is defined, the socreate process is free to
     return any desired error code.  The socket() system call will pass this
     error code along (even if it is undefined).
