POLL(2) 		      System Calls Manual		       POLL(2)

NAME
     poll – synchronous I/O multiplexing

SYNOPSIS
     #include <poll.h>

     int
     poll(struct pollfd fds[], nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

DESCRIPTION
     poll() examines a set of file descriptors to see if some of them are
     ready for I/O or if certain events have occurred on them.	The fds
     argument is a pointer to an array of pollfd structures, as defined in
     ⟨poll.h⟩ (shown below).  The nfds argument specifies the size of the fds
     array.

     struct pollfd {
	 int	fd;	  /* file descriptor */
	 short	events;   /* events to look for */
	 short	revents;  /* events returned */
     };

     The fields of struct pollfd are as follows:

     fd 	    File descriptor to poll.

     events	    Events to poll for.  (See below.)

     revents	    Events which may occur or have occurred.  (See below.)

     The event bitmasks in events and revents have the following bits:

     POLLERR	    An exceptional condition has occurred on the device or
		    socket.  This flag is output only, and ignored if present
		    in the input events bitmask.

     POLLHUP	    The device or socket has been disconnected.  This flag is
		    output only, and ignored if present in the input events
		    bitmask.  Note that POLLHUP and POLLOUT are mutually
		    exclusive and should never be present in the revents
		    bitmask at the same time.

     POLLIN	    Data other than high priority data may be read without
		    blocking.  This is equivalent to ( POLLRDNORM | POLLRDBAND
		    ).

     POLLNVAL	    The file descriptor is not open.  This flag is output
		    only, and ignored if present in the input events bitmask.

     POLLOUT	    Normal data may be written without blocking.  This is
		    equivalent to POLLWRNORM.

     POLLPRI	    High priority data may be read without blocking.

     POLLRDBAND     Priority data may be read without blocking.

     POLLRDNORM     Normal data may be read without blocking.

     POLLWRBAND     Priority data may be written without blocking.

     POLLWRNORM     Normal data may be written without blocking.

     The distinction between normal, priority, and high-priority data is
     specific to particular file types or devices.

     If timeout is greater than zero, it specifies a maximum interval (in
     milliseconds) to wait for any file descriptor to become ready.  If
     timeout is zero, then poll() will return without blocking. If the value
     of timeout is -1, the poll blocks indefinitely.

RETURN VALUES
     poll() returns the number of descriptors that are ready for I/O, or -1 if
     an error occurred.  If the time limit expires, poll() returns 0.  If
     poll() returns with an error, including one due to an interrupted call,
     the fds array will be unmodified and the global variable errno will be
     set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     poll() will fail if:

     [EAGAIN]		Allocation of internal data structures fails.  A
			subsequent request may succeed.

     [EFAULT]		Fds points outside the process's allocated address
			space.

     [EINTR]		A signal is delivered before the time limit expires
			and before any of the selected events occurs.

     [EINVAL]		The nfds argument is greater than OPEN_MAX or the
			timeout argument is less than -1.

BUGS
     The poll() system call currently does not support devices.
