# webserv

## usage

1. Compile the webserver running `make` on the root directory of the project
2. Start the webserver with `./webserver`
3. Open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
4. Enjoy the response of the webserv!

# Coding Style Guidelines

- **Variable Naming**: Use camelCase for variable names, except for classes which should be PascalCase.
- **File Naming**:
  - Use snake_case for regular files (excluding files containing classes).
  - Use PascalCase for files containing classes.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Follow the Orthodox Canonical Form.
- **Header and Implementation Separation**: Avoid separation of header and implementation files for classes in our internal style guide.
